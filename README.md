couchdb-copydoc
===============

An interface to couch db's replication engine, to copy single couchdb documents across servers easily. Written in nodejs/jade/foundation.

Note:
This is still alpha code, and bugs are still awry. Help contribute and help me sqaush those nasty bugs!
Would like to make this more dynamic in the future to add/save servers and settings through some sort of panel.

Required Values to set:
===============
Under copydoc.js set the following values
1. Set servers and datbases
2. Set Authentication, if needed
3. Set User Ctx Values
